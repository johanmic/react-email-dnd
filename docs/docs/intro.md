# React Email DnD Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the React Email drag-and-drop toolkit. These guides break down the two core runtime experiences—**Editor** and **Renderer**—and detail the JSON schema that connects them.

- Start with the concepts section to understand the responsibilities of each subsystem.
- Dive into the Editor documentation to learn how to configure the builder experience, add components, and control styling primitives.
- Review the Renderer guides to see how delivery clients consume your component library and typography.
- Finish with the JSON structure reference when you need exact field names or want to extend the format safely.
- Use the example walk-throughs to replicate the drag-and-drop editor shell and renderer playground in your own apps.

Pick any topic from the sidebar or follow the recommended order above to move from foundational ideas to implementation details.
